# Contribution Policy

Cloud.gov is an open source project operated by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) to support federal agency missions. While we value transparency and collaboration, we must balance openness with the responsibilities of operating a secure, compliant, and trusted federal platform.

## Who can contribute

We welcome contributions, however, to avoid the appearance of government endorsement, manage supply chain risk, and maintain the integrity of our compliance posture, we can only accept contributions when:

1. You are affiliated with the federal government as
   1. an employee of a U.S. federal agency, or
   2. a contractor working under a current agreement with a U.S. government entity, or
   3. a GSA-approved contributor as part of official interagency collaboration. 
1. Your contribution is non-trivial (e.g. more than fixing a link, a typographical error, or grammar), unless you're an established contributor. 
2. Your GitHub account has an established history.

If you're unsure whether your contribution fits, feel free to open an issue first so we can discuss it.
